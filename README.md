# 👋 Hi there, I'm Bilyaminu Ahmad

I'm a passionate **Backend Developer** with a strong focus on building scalable, secure, and real-world backend systems using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. My work reflects clean architecture, robust authentication mechanisms, and production-ready APIs that solve real business needs.
As a self-learned creative and passionate programmer/developer I like to build and develop software for any platform. Learning, improving skills, solving problems, and adapting to new technologies are my hobbies. I can give my total effort and work well in a team, with responsibility.

## 💼 Projects That Define Me:
- 🚀 **[FreshMart Supermarket Backend](https://github.com/AhmedBilyameen/freshmart-backend)**  
  A full-fledged e-commerce backend featuring role-based access control, JWT/refresh token auth, product browsing, order management, and password reset flows. Built to mirror a real-world supermarket platform.
  
- 📦 **[Lost & Found System](https://github.com/AhmedBilyameen/lost-found-backend)**  
  A backend system for reporting, managing, and retrieving lost items. Emphasizes CRUD operations, user auth, and efficient data handling.

- 🔒 **ICS Ransomware Research Simulation (KAUST Internship Application)**  
  A backend-focused simulation tackling ransomware in industrial control systems—highlighting my interest in system resilience and cyber-security in critical infrastructure.

## 🛠 Tech Stack:
- **Languages & Frameworks:** JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js, Express.js, Java (basic)
- **Databases:** MongoDB, SQL
- **Tools & Practices:** Postman, Git, QGIS (for geo-data analysis), Nodemailer, MVC Architecture
- **Others:** RESTful APIs, Authentication & Authorization, Clean Code, Scalable Project Structure

## 📈 What Makes Me Stand Out:
- I don’t just build — I **design systems** with clarity and purpose.
- Committed to writing **professional-grade code** with best practices and reusability in mind.
- I proactively **simulate real-world use cases** to make my projects relevant and impactful.
- Active learner, consistently improving through structured projects and online coursework (e.g., Coursera certifications in **Data Analysis** & **Advanced Microsoft Office**).

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- Advanced backend patterns (queues, caching, testing)
- TypeScript and Docker for better scalability
- Frontend (React) for full-stack integration
